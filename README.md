# Under-water-enhancement
1. To further enhance underwater images, we can apply a method called color correction. Underwater images tend to have a blue or green tint due to the absorption and scattering of light by water. Color correction can help to restore the natural colors in the image.
Code â€“ newclahe.m (color correction using the gray world assumption)

Note that the color correction method used in this code assumes that the average values of the R, G, and B channels should be equal, which may not always be the case. Other color correction methods can be used depending on the specific characteristics of the underwater image.
